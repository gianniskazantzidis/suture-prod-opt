# Thesis Repository: Multi-Period Production Scheduling with Scenario Analysis

This repository contains all files and scripts used for my thesis titled **"Optimization of Sutures Production Processes: Multi-Period Mathematical Modeling"**. The thesis explores production optimization through various scenarios and models, aiming to enhance operational efficiency.

## Repository Structure

- **Thesis_PDF.pdf**: The full thesis document, detailing the methodology, models, and results.
- ***Combination-* folders**: Each folder contains data and files related to the results of the specific experiment combinations and scenarios analyzed in the thesis.
- **main.py**: The primary script to initialize and run the models.
- **models.py**: Contains model definitions for the single-period model and the 3 multi-period models.
- **parameters.py**: Parameter definitions used across the models.
- **run_model.py**: Function that takes the desired model to test and prepares it for the scenario analysis.
- **scenario_analysis.py**: Analyzes different scenarios and outputs plots of the results.
- **gurobi.log**: Log file from Gurobi optimization runs.
- **LICENSE**: License for this repository.
- **README.md**: This file.
